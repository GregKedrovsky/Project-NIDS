The snortd file goes in /etc/init.d/

It is designed to start Snort as a daemon on boot.
After copying the snortd file to /etc/init.d/ you need to run:

    sudo update-rc.d snortd defaults

This will copy the required files/links into the rc?.d directories.

For usage just run this command:

    /etc/init.d/snortd

To remove it, just delete the snortd file from /etc/init.d/ and
run the following:

    sudo update-rc.d snortd remove
